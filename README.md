Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

After 10 years of experience in Education in Japan, I have transitioned back to engineering and Data science full time since March 2024. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data science and NLP

Stuff I do:

    Programming: Python, Git, SQL, BigQuery, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
    Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Transformers
    NLP: Huggingface, W3C standards, APIs, fine-tuning, TF-IDF, embeddings, cosine similarity
    Cloud & Product Development: Google Cloud Platform, Docker, Streamlit
    
Languages I speak:

    French (native), English (native), Japanese (business)

Stuff I've done: (some repos are private, sorry!)

    Gibo (NLP): Developed a message classifier using TF-IDF and active learning, achieving 80%+ accuracy with minimal user input.
    E-Commerce (Olist): Built a model to predict trends and reduce losses using historical e-commerce data (2016-2018).
    Image Classification: Experimented with PCA and CNN models to classify datasets (e.g., CIFAR, shapes, president faces).
    HelpMePublish: Built a journal prediction tool using customized Transformers, embeddings, and cosine similarities.
    Tokyo Global Gateway: Managed and processed large datasets for recruitment, attendance tracking, and performance review.

I'm proud of having graduated from:

    Data Science and AI Bootcamp â€“ Le Wagon, Tokyo (Mar 2024 - Sep 2024)
      Python, SQL, BigQuery, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Google Cloud Platform, Docker, Streamlit
    Masterâ€™s in Microelectronic Systems and Architectures â€“ CPE Lyon, France (Sep 2013)
    Bachelorâ€™s in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Computer Science â€“ CPE Lyon, France (Sep 2010)
