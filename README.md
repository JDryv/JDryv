# Hi, I'm Jack 👋  

After 10 years of experience in Education in Japan, I have transitioned back to engineering and Data Science full-time since March 2024.  

🌱 I’m currently learning about Data Science and NLP.  

## Stuff I Do  

- **Programming:** Python, Git, SQL, BigQuery, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Transformers  
- **NLP:** Huggingface, W3C standards, APIs, fine-tuning, TF-IDF, embeddings, cosine similarity  
- **Cloud & Product Development:** Google Cloud Platform, Docker, Streamlit  

## Languages I Speak  

- French (native)  
- English (native)  
- Japanese (business)  

## Stuff I've Done (Some Repos Are Private, Sorry!)  

- **Gibo (NLP):** Developed a message classifier using TF-IDF and active learning, achieving 80%+ accuracy with minimal user input.  
- **E-Commerce (Olist):** Built a model to predict trends and reduce losses using historical e-commerce data (2016-2018).  
- **Image Classification:** Experimented with PCA and CNN models to classify datasets (e.g., CIFAR, shapes, president faces).  
- **HelpMePublish:** Built a journal prediction tool using customized Transformers, embeddings, and cosine similarities.  
- **Tokyo Global Gateway:** Managed and processed large datasets for recruitment, attendance tracking, and performance review.
